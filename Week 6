# Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?

This week was focused upon how complex systems evolve over time and what causes these changes. There were 3 main modelling concepts we learnt this week: Markov 
Models, Random Walks, and Riots, Broadcast, Diffusion and Contagion. I feel like I learnt the most about Markov Models as they were the easiest for me to process
by applying them to a variety of scenarios. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Now I know that there are a plethora of models that we can use for pretty much any system. The example shown in class for Markov Models, about the alert vs bored 
students was particularly intriguing to me as I could relate to that scenario. It was very exciting knowing that you can even model the most common daily scenarios
and create statistical equilibriums. It was also interesting seeing how I could use Markov models in future business applications. 

### What insights have I gained?

A main insight that I gained from this week's content was that it honestly does not matter how difficult and question or scenario is, but rather, it is up to me 
and my perspective to decide the best way to approach a problem to make it easier for myself. I also gained insights into ideas for the group project as the
broadcast model related very well with my team's chosen topic. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A weakness that I have noticed this week while working on the group assignment with my group is that I sometimes struggle with voicing my opinion to my group 
members as I do not want them to think I am too overbearing, authoritative or "bossy". But this teamwork project has helped me overcome this and taught me that
communication and trust are essential to work together with my group to achieve optimal results at the end of the semester. 

A strength that I have observed is my writing abilities which allowed me to contribute good quality work to the group assignment. Thus, I am quite proud of my 
contributions to the team project.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week I was unable to attend the workshop as I was very sick on the day of the class. So a main challenge for me was to make sure that I had caught up with all 
the content that I had missed (individually) so that I was not left behind, and that I properly understood the concepts. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I will try to attend the class workshop and do the pre-readings so that I do not feel confused during class. This is also important as I need to gain a 
stronger understanding of modelling concepts so that I can contribute well to my group.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As I could not attend the workshop this week, I will not be able to provide a detailed response for this section. But from my understanding, the contagion SIR model
was the most useful as it directly applies to the contemporary context of a global pandemic. From this model, I learnt the benefits of getting majority of the 
population vaccinated as this is an important and effective strategy to overcome disease spread in a system.
