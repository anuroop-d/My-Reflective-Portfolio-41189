# Week 5


### What have I learnt this week?

This week, half of the workshop was breakout room activities in which I learnt about the unique applications of 
Agent Based Models and UML Class diagrams. During the task of agent-based modelling of multiple different scenarios, I 
was able to practice my ability to apply knowledge to real-world examples while discussing with my group members. Further,
as I have no current coding experience, I did not know how to create an algorithm using a coding language. But a group 
member who did have experience, helped us out and taught me how to create a simple algorithm, which I was very 
grateful for. Ultimately, this breakout room activity also taught me the benefits of working with new people as I was able
to gain different perspectives and expand on my own knowledge.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Prior to this week, although I had some knowledge on graphs, I did not know the in-depth details, such as the fact that 
not every quantity can be written as a sum or random variable. As this was new information, it was initially confusing to
wrap my head around these mathematical concepts and facts. Most importantly, I learnt about the uses of long-tailed
distributions and how they can be applied to situations such as city populations etc. 

### What insights have I gained?

As I had already studies probability distribution graphs previously, I had expected for some of this week's content to just 
be revision, however, I was surprised to gain new insights into the models that produce power laws. For example, I was 
surprised to realise that models such as self-organised criticality can produce power-law distributions. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

This week, I observed that a strength of mine was efficiently gathering knowledge from the Ted Talk for this week's 
Discussion Board, and applying those concepts to how this would impact my future career. As such, I have been quite
enjoying the areas of this subject that encourage us to apply the knowledge to personal experiences.

A weakness I observed this week was being able to manage my time effectively between all my assignments so that I can 
focus on the pre-submission for this subject that is upcoming.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

For the pre-submission, my group decided that I would be in charge of sections 2.1 and 2.2. Section 2.2 was about
constructing a rich picture and I was very confused about how to do this as I had never heard of a "rich picture" before. 
In order to overcome this issue, I conducted research and also emailed the tutors for advice. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I would like to put in more time and effort into my Discussion Board posts so that I can achieve higher marks
than I have been receiving so far. I also need to remember to comment on other people's posts, as this would be a key 
learning opportunity for me to grow from the perspectives and knowledge provided by other class members. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

This week, the theory that proved to be most useful was the Long-tailed distribution theory. This is because I was 
thoroughly enjoying the unique and diverse applications of this model in a variety of concepts. This model taught me that
even mathematical graphs can have interesting trends (as I previously disliked maths in high school). I also considered 
trying to include such as graph into my group's pre-submission assignment.
