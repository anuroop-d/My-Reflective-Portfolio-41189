# Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt that there are many, many more models and modelling systems than I was previously aware of. I learnt that models don't necessarily need to have
a mathematical base and some can be used in philosophical ways.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Now I know that models are an inherent part of our lives and used in many unique situations that I previously did not know, and did not even consider. 

### What insights have I gained?

I realised that models in all forms are around us and in our daily lives. As I always learn better by applying theory and concepts from class into real-world
scenarios, I was able to get much deeper insights into the concept of modelling systems as this week's class was focused on real-world examples.
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As this was only the first week of official content learning, there were not any particular challenges that I felt I needed to overcome.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

From next week onwards, I plan on reading ahead through the content on Canvas so I can feel better prepared, and less confused in class. This will also be 
beneficial as I will then be able to ask specific questions to the tutor. The results I aim to achieve through doing this are getting a more well-rounded 
understanding of this subject's theory, which will hopefully give me an advantage for the final group assignment task. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Personally, I found the wisdom hierarchy theory extremely useful and interesting. The reason for this is because I have always enjoyed studying the psychology
behind human behaviour and I was surprised to find out you can model human behaviour in all these different ways. For that reason, the wisdom hierarchy will
definitely prove to be very useful in my future learning (whether it is for classwork or my own personal learning).
