# Week 11

### What have I learnt this week?

This week, much like the last two weeks, was based upon completing the group assignment. As such, the only thing I learnt this week was the importance of dividing
up tasks equally among each group member. The reason I am focusing on this is because I am very grateful that my group all equally divided up the workload so that
we all had small portions to complete. This limited feelings of stress. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I believe that now I know much more about the skills required to work together in a team as my group has definitely developed and grown significantly in the past
few weeks as a result of better commuincation and trusting each other to completed their assigned tasks. 

### What insights have I gained?

While completing this assignment, I realised that there are many different ways to approach something in order to achieve the desired result. Whether this was in 
relation to the many different models we learnt about, or relating to the practical teamwork skills required for this project, I believe these were key insights 
that I gained through this subject.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My perceived strength is my ability to divide up tasks between the group evenly. I also made sure to focus on communication and asked the group members to let us 
know if they were struggling with something so that we as a group could overcome them. As such, I realised I have certain leadership qualities that I only 
developed this year through various group assignments. 

As the semester is almost over and there are no more classes, I have no other noticeable weaknesses that I have perceived. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The main challenge I observed was completing my allocated sections of the group assignment to a high standard so that my group members would not be disappointed 
with my level of skills. This was challenging as I ended up spending too much time of certain parts of the assignment in my attempts to over-achieve. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I would like to discuss with my group about our collective goal as well as the skills and weaknesses of each individual member. This would allow the 
entire group to gain an understanding of the goals of each member, and allocate tasks based on an individual's strengths.
