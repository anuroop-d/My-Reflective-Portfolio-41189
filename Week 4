# Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?

This week was focused upon learning and understanding 3 key models: systems dynamics models, network models, and agent-based models.
One important thing I learnt at the start of this week's workshop was the 5 Phase Process, and I think this would be very useful 
for applying to the final project as my group is currently at the stage of choosing our models and topic. The 5 Phase Process will
help us decide what models can be implemented to most effectively answer our chosen topic. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

One main thing I learnt this week is the different forms of flow charts and diagrams, specifically, the Causal Lopp Diagram. Prior
to learning this, I had assumed that the only form of flowchart as the simple data flow ones that use arrows. But the Causal Loop
Diagram is unique as it considers reinforcing and balancing loops which are applicable to many real-world situations.

### What insights have I gained?

I gained some very interesting insights into the ways that you can graph and model different modes of behaviour. As I mentioned in 
last week's reflection, I had not previously considered that human behaviour was so predictable that it could be modelled. 
Furthering adding onto that, this week, I was surprised to learn that you can graph behaviour to observe trends such as growth,
oscillation, overshoot etc. This was very insightful as now I know that I can combine the structures and behaviours of models 
to create systems of anything at all. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
My perceived weakness this week was probably my ability to remain focused in the 3 hour long workshops for this subject. However, 
the tutors made this much easier for me this weak my including a breakout room activity to allow me to focus my brain
on working on a specific activity.

A strength I observed this week, while working in the breakout rooms was my ability to initiate discussion and conversation
among my peers. Most often, breakout rooms are quite awkward and uncomfortable in the first few minutes but I have noticed that I 
have a tendency to try to start conversation and encourage the group to focus on the activity we are expected to complete.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The major challenge I faced this week while working on my group assignment was that me and my group struggled with picking and 
finalising on three main models to relate to our chosen topic for the project. Personally, this was a challenge for myself as I
kept overthinking and convincing myself that I would be able to find a better, more applicable model if I researched a bit more, 
but this was not feasible due to the limited time we had. So, in order to overcome this, as noticed that no one in my group was
particularly authoritative, we decided to just list out the models we liked, and then we all voted on our three favourite ones. 
This was an effective strategy as it allowed us to compromise and the majority's decision won.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

In order to overcome my struggles in focusing in the 3 hour long workshops, next time I will come better prepared to class. This
means that I will not only have done the pre-readings, but have made detailed notes so that I will be developing on my knowlegde 
through the lectures, rather than learning concepts for the first time. This will also enable me to ask specific questions based
upon the distinct areas of the content that I struggle with, overall enhancing my knowledge in the long-term. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The theory that I found to be very useful this week was the network models theory. This is because, based upon the examples from
the class lecture, I realised that there are many forms of networks all around me that I had not even previously noticed. The
different structures and agents in network models is highly intriguing as so, my group chose this as one of the models for our 
final project. From this model, I learnt that networks significantly change based upon clustering and nodes, and I realised that 
there are many preferential attachment and small world models around me (e.g. generally, certain backgrounds cluster together 
in one suburb).
