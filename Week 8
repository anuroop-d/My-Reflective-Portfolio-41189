# Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?

This week was focused upon two key models: Colonel Blotto Game and the Prisoner's Dilemma. I liked that these two models were different to the previous models we 
had been studying and were more like games or problems we needed to solve. The Colonel Blotto Game relied on emergent behaviour and rational human behaviour 
predictions to create winning strategies. It was interesting learning about all the different applications of a game that originally started out as a war strategy.
It was also very surprising learning that this game has no "best" or "optimal" winning strategy, as is all completely reliant on chance, luck and one's ability to
predict your opponent's move.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Although I had heard of the Colonel Blotto game before, I did not realise that it originally started out as a strategy utilised in the battlefield, and it has now 
become a fun, game that tests your strategising skills. Nowadays, this game can be used in any situation where people need to make strategic decisions, even in a
corporate business scenario. This was very intriguing to me as I have always liked games that rely on your ability to guess your opponent's moves and strategies.

### What insights have I gained?

During this week's workshop, I gained insights into the unique aspects and games involved in Game Theory. When we learnt about the prisoner's dilemma theory, I 
realised that humans always have an inherent conflict between acting selfishly for their own good, or attempting to do what is good for the collective. This 
insight made me realise that we as humans have an inherent greed/selfishness that is based upon the thinking of "survival of the fittest". It was very interesting
to be able to apply such psychological theories and human predictions models in a game like this one. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

During this week, I observed that I was particularly good at communication and teamwork among my group. Because the pre submission was due this week, I decided to
take initiative and check over/edit everyone's sections of the report to make sure everything flowed well. I also initiated group discussions and suggested doing
a videocall to finalise everything. This made me feel relatively proud of my communication skills and so I think this is a strength of mine. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The main challenge my team faced this week was based upon time management and referencing sources in the assignment. One particular team member was struggling with 
time and had many references left to complete on the night that the pre-submission was due. As a team, the rest of the group members overcame this issue by working
together and dividing up the tasks so that we had all completed everything within 30 minutes. This challenge and the process we used to overcome this specific 
challenge, reminded me of the importance of trusting your team members and being able to rely on them when necessary. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I would like to have all group members complete the assignment at least one entire day prior to the due date. This will allow everyone to revise and edit
the writing and referencing, without putting any unnecessary stress on anyone. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As this week was just based on finishing up the pre submission assignment, there were no theories in particular that I referred back to.
