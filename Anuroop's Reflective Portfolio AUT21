# Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

* Emergence within a system: this was very interesting and fascinating to learn about in our lesson

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

* The difference between complex and complicated systems: prior to this lesson I always heard these phrases but assumed them to be the same thing.
* The many different types of complex systems as they were all very unique and I would never have realised that some of them are complex systems

### What insights have I gained?

* Anything and everything can be regarded as a 'system'
* Prior to this lesson, I would never have realised the immense amount of systems surrounding me in my daily life
* When learning about the importance of system boundaries, I was reminded of how controls are implemented in science experiments for a very similar reason and purpose.
* This subject of human-centred systems is almost philosophical in some ways

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

* Strengths: Being able to notice different complex systems in my daily life
* Weaknesses: understanding of programs such as GitHub, Jupyter, Python. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I struggled with completely understanding certain parts of the lesson due to my lack of prior experience or reading. Hence, from this week onwards, I will take extra 
time to prepare myself for the content being covered so I will be able to ask questions to gain further knowlegde.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

As I am still a beginner in regards to programming and IT, I am worried that I will fall behind in comparison to the rest of the class. In order to overcome this,
I have decided to take initiative and research the basics (specifically about how to effectively use GitHub as this subject does not require other coding programs).
I believe that if I can fully understand how to effectively use GitHub for my studies, I will be able to achieve strong results for the Reflective Portfolio assignment.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

* The concept of mental biases was extremely interesting and made me reflect on how biases can impact upon one's perception of the world; not in just social situations,
 but also in the formation of models and work-related instances.
