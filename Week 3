# Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

This week's content was primarily focused on behaviour

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

### What insights have I gained?

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week, we formed groups for the assignments for this subject. As we would be working in these groups throughout the semester, I wanted to build strong teamwork
and get to know each of my team members well. However, I encountered an issue when I noticed that my group was acting uncooperative and any group discussion felt
uncomfortable. In order to overcome this issue, I create a group chat with each group member so that we could discuss the assignment and get to know each other 
outside of a classroom environment. I also assumed that the team members were only awkward and shy as no one knew each other yet, so I took it upon myself to 
initiate some discussion and even offered to have a group meeting sometime outside of class (whether online through Zoom or on campus). My group all agreed and
seemed to appreciate my initiating of conversations as it 'broke the ice' and most members were very cooperative after that day.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
