# Week 12

### What have I learnt this week?

By this week, I had already completed all my required parts of the group assignment and focused on other assignments, as well as completing the 1000 word
reflection for this subject. Thus, I can say that the only main thing I learnt this week was managing my time wisely by dividing up tasks based on importance and
priority. I also learnt how to cope with stress and feelings of unmotivation during my first ever university exam/assignment period. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

While reflecting upon this subject over the past 12 weeks, I definitely learnt many, many new types of models and theories that I did not know before. Further, 
in my group assignment, we focused on 3 main models: Forest Fire model, Small World Networks model, and a Causal Loop Diagram. By focusing my learning on these 
3 models for the past few weeks, I gained a much deeper understanding into the workings, theories and real-world applications of each of these models.

### What insights have I gained?

A key insight I learnt was that modelling and systems can actually be surprisingly interesting. Coming into this subject at the start of the semester, I had a 
pre-conceived bias that models and systems required lots of maths and coding (which I am very weak at) so I thought I would not like this subject. However, a 
very important insight I gained across this semester was that there are many forms of models that do not require maths or coding, and the behavioural models in 
particular were extremely interesting to me. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My perceived strength is my communication and team work skills. At the start of the semester, I thought I would struggle with my communication with my group members
but while I worked on the group project, I realised I have some inherent leadership qualities. I realised that when everyone else in my group is shy or unwilling 
to discuss, I take initiate to instigate conversations and discussions.

A perceived weakness of my would probably my time-management skills, which were especially difficult as this time I knew I had other team members relying on me and
I did not want to let them down. I will definitely work on this weakness over the following semesters and subjects.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The main challenge my team faced across this semester was our ability to discuss and compromise on issues when we all had different perspectives. I think we handled
this relatively well by respectfully talking to each other and understanding different opinions.
