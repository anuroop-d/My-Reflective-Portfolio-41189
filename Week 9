# Week 9

### What have I learnt this week?

This week there was no class and instead I used this opportunity to catch up on some of my notes and complete the recent Week 8 discussion board. The week 8 
Discussion Board was mainly based on the Colonel Blotto theory from last week's workshop, and I learnt that they are a surprisingly vast amount of ways that 
this game theory can be applied to real world situations. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

While I was constructing my Colonel Blotto game plan and dividing up my 100 soldiers among 10 castles, I noticed that games like this have no specific winning
strategy and instead was based upon my luck and ability to predict what game plans the other students in my class would create. Thus, now I know that there are
games that exist in this world that have no winning strategy, and is just purely based on luck.

### What insights have I gained?

The second half of the Discussion Board was based upon the application of the Colonel Blotto Game to our current Covid-19 society. During my writing of this week's
discussion post, I gained some highly interesting insights into the many different strategies that different countries have implemented in attempts to 
counteract the coronavirus. It was interesting seeing the different ways that different governments try to combat this pandemic, as well as how different
citizen populations react to their government's laws and restrictions.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

This week there were no specific strengths or weaknesses I observed, but instead, while I was working on the assignment, I realised that I have gained skills
regarding my ability to write concisely. This was definitely a major improvement for me as I remember struggling with this earlier in the semester. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week, after the feedback from the pre-submission, my group decided to adjust the chosen topic for the report, and also change one of our models for our topic.
This situation was highly stressful as we struggled with finalising the new topic, but we overcame this by scheduling a meeting with the tutors to ask for specific
assistance and advice for the final assignment. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I would try to email or ask my tutors about any major problems much earlier on in the semester so that the group would not have to change something major
at the very last minute.
