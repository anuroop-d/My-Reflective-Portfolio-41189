# Week 10

### What have I learnt this week?

This week, I learnt how to create a Casual Loop Diagram (CLD). Although we had already learnt the theory behind a CLD is one of the class lecture's several weeks
ago, this was the first time I participated in creating a very detailed version of a CLD that was based on a complex yet interesting topic. The purpose of creating
a CLD was for the final group assignment in which I helped my team member create one. The pre-submission assignment, coupled with this final report assignment has 
taught me a lot regarding how to apply content and theory learnt in class to specific situations and contexts, and it highly interesting.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

This may be slightly unrelated to the class content or the expectations of this question, but this week, I mainly found out important and very interesting
information regarding my team's chosen topic for the assignment. Our chosen topic is "How do targeted advertisements on social media counteract the weaknesses
present in traditional marketing and advertising methods." Thus, on a broader level, I learnt and found out key information regarding the extremely slow process 
of traditional marketing prior to the internet. Of course, I had some general knowledge and assumptions about how advertisements existed prior to technological
advancements but I was still surprised by some interesting research I came upon. 

### What insights have I gained?

As this week - like last week - was focused on working with our teams on our assignments, I gained some key insights into the advantages as well as minor 
problems that are always bound to exist when working in a collaborative environment. In particular, I learnt some tips and ideas for working with
team members and ways to allow everyone to work together seamlessly. This assignment has definitely made me consider the potential applications of my 
skills in future career opportunities, and I have realised that I would definitely prefer team work over individually working by myself. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

For strengths, as I mentioned above, I definitely think I have observed that I am very good at working in teams. My observant nature has always caused me to 
consider the feelings and reactions of other people in any situation (from a young age). So, during the team meeting my group had this week, I felt proud of 
myself for instigating discussion and responding to everyone's ideas, as well as trying to include the more quieter team members into our discussions. 

My main weakness that I have percieved while working on this assignment is probably my lack of time management skills during large assignments like this as I 
immediately get overwhelmed by the large workload. Then, I sometimes spend too much time working on my delegated tasks as I feel the need to perfect my writing so
that my team members will be impressed by my work. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One challenged I encountered this week is my ability to be concise and focus on the bigger picture when conducting research and doing report writing. For one part
of the assignment, I am in charge of researching the literature components and I keep getting distracted by a variety of interesting information and wanting to
include everything into my work. But it is important to be concise and only include the most important information. This is a skill that I definitely need to 
improve on as it will be highly beneficial in the future, in a variety of aspects (e.g. future subjects, writing reports, admin jobs, future career etc.).

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I will definitely aim to improve upon my time management skills as well as my ability to be succinct in my writing. In order to do this, I may implement
methods such as set timers, weekly planners or even ask other people to check up on my work in order to hold myself accountable. Hopefully, if I improve on some
of the issues I faced this week, it will result in me working more smoothly on assignments and feeling less stressed the closer I get to the submission date.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

This week, the only theory I used from the classwork was the Casual Loop Diagram, as I mainly focused on the researching aspect. This was very useful as it taught
me the genuine real-world applications of systems and models. It was very interesting relating a CLD to advertising methods but it definitely taught me how broad
many different models can be as they allow us to model literally anything - in any preferred way. For this reason, the utilisation of a CLD was genuinely exciting
and interesting, and made me want to try applying other models to real-world situations around me.
