# Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt a variety of content relating to emergent behaviours, which was a concept that we studied in the first week of this semester. The three main
types of emergent behaviour we studied was: Peer Effects & Social Contagion, Coordination & Culture, Social Learning. The main things I learnt this week was about
how information spreads and how we can model certain cultures and social learning. Personally, I found this week's workshop to be very interesting as I enjoyed
being able to apply the three emergent behaviours to personal events in my life. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The main thing that I know now, that I did not previously know is that human behaviour is almost always influenced by the people around us. Although I had noticed
this before, I never realised that this could be applied to every situation. I was able to relate this to some common situations in my personal life such as 
fashion trends, gossip, or even video games that become popular for only a brief period of time.

### What insights have I gained?

One insight gained this week, was that I developed upon my knowledge of riots models from last week by learning this week that variance will drive behaviour. This
was a major insight that I gained as it allowed me to further expand upon my knowledge of riot models and how these can be applied. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

This week I noticed that a key strength of mine was creating flow diagrams as I was in charge of creating a Rich Picture for the pre-submission assignment. After 
thorough research, I was quite proud of the final product that I had worked hard on. I also realised I am strong at using LucidChart for these types of flow 
diagrams. 

A weakness I observed was probably my ability to focus in the 3 hour long class. I have definitely identified this weakness in previous weeks' reflections and 
despite working hard to remain focused, I struggled this week (even though I had found the content very engaging and intriguing).

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time, I will like to manage my time better as the pre-submission assignment is due next week and I want to put in adequate effort into my teamwork and 
contributions. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Personally, I found Schelling's Segregation Model to be very useful as it related very well to my group's final project topic. However, unfortunately, the team had
already finalsied 3 models and did not want to change any of those. Instead, I began observing how Schelling's Segregation Model applied to my daily life and learnt
that many suburbs in Sydney are segregated based on things such as wealth or culture.
